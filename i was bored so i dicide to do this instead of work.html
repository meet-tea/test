<br>
<p class="normal">Background information: About 250 million years ago, and due to extreme hot temperature, creatures adapted by giving birth to their offsprings (skipping the fetal stage).</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="semititle">The benefit of the new evolutionary change:</p>
<br>
<p class="normal">One of the major benefits of the first mammals is that they are warm-blooded meaning that they didn´t have to hibernate to deal with the cold due to the fact that they grew hair that helps suppress the heat you release so it’ll be more warmer. They also had bigger kidneys due to the fact that they needed to expand their diet so they’ll grow bigger and adapt to the land<p>
<br>
<p class="semititle">Explanation of evidence:</p>
<br>
<p class="normal">They don't have to lay down and rest because they are warmblooded and have bigger lungs leading to better metabolism. They also had bigger kidneys for a greater production of waste such as poop and pee. These can be used to fertilize the land around their territory which can lead to more grass as such, which then helps them with the food shortage.</p>
<br>
<p class="semititle">What this evolutionary event means for the future of life on Earth:</p>
<br>
<p class="normal">It becomes easier for parents to protect their children due to them having a will so they’ll be able to and they can easily hunt down prey. The reproduction is probably pretty balanced. Extinction rates will rise because of the lack of reproduction included with being hunted by multiple predators.</p>
